# Rock vs Mine Prediction

This project uses a Logistic Regression model to predict whether an object is a rock or a mine based on sonar data.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Sonar dataset, which contains 60 features representing sonar readings and a label indicating whether the object is a rock (R) or a mine (M).

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:

- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
3. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
4. Train the Logistic Regression model using the training data.
5. Evaluate the model's accuracy on both the training and testing data.
6. Use the trained model to make predictions on new data.
